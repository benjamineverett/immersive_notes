		<p>Hi, my name is Ben and I'm from Philadelphia, <span style="color:orange">PA</span>, though I grew up in
			 the aptly named town of Paradise; also in Pennsylvania. </p>
		<p>My wife and I move to <span style="color:orange">Colorado</span> a year and a half ago to take
			advantage of the great weather and fun-loving culture.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<h4>My favorite animals are as follows:</h4>
		<ul>
			<a href="http://www.seaotters.org/information/uploads/2013/02/Abby-the-otter-11-1480x604.jpg"><li>Otters</li></a>
			<li>Wolverines</li>
			<li>Ferrets</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Most people don't know that all these animals are a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae">
			Weasel</a> family.
			It is most common for people to think that ferrets are rodents. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNbqvqf3-14">I can assure you they are most certainly not.</a></p>
